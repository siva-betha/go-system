# Feature: Augmented Reality (AR) Maintenance Assistant

## Value Proposition
- **Ensure Quality**: Drastic reduction in human error during complex chamber maintenance procedures.
- **Tribal Knowledge Capture**: Embed the expertise of veteran engineers directly into the digital overlay for junior staff.
- **Reduce MTTR**: Speed up Mean Time to Repair by providing instant visual guidance and parts identification.

## Technical Implementation
- **Platform**: Mobile (iOS/Android) and AR Headsets (HoloLens, Magic Leap).
- **Vision AI**: Object recognition to identify screws, valves, and gaskets; 3D spatial mapping to track tool position.
- **Data Integration**: Real-time display of sensor values (e.g., pressure, temperature) overlaid on physical hardware components.

## User Experience
- Step-by-step 3D guided walkthroughs for every SEMI-standard maintenance task.
- "Before/After" performance validation: Compare tool OES signature before maintenance vs. after to confirm success.
- Digital "Sign-off" integrated with the MES/CMMS audit trail.
